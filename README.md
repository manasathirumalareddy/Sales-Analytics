# Sales Performance Reports

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating two comprehensive sales reports that will help businesses evaluate customer performance and compare market performance against targets. 
The reports offer actionable insights that empower businesses to optimize sales strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue.

## Project Description
In this project, I have created two key reports for the sales team:

 **Customer Performance Report**: This report provides net sales performance of each customer across different years. It helps businesses assess the effectiveness of their
 customer relationships and determine areas for improvement or potential expansion.

 **Market Performance vs Target Report**: This report compares the actual performance of markets (countries) against predefined targets, allowing stakeholders to assess 
 whether targets are being met and identify any gaps or opportunities for growth.

### Key Features:
- **Pivot Tables**: Used to summarize large datasets and allow easy manipulation for reporting.
- **Power Query**: Applied to clean and transform data before analysis.
- **DAX (Basics)**: Utilized to create basic calculations and aggregations to enhance the report functionality.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Applied to visually highlight key trends and exceptions in the data.
- **Report Beautification**: Focused on making the reports visually appealing and easy to understand.
- **Sales Domain Metrics**: Designed specifically to address key sales metrics for better business decision-making.

## Benefits for Businesses
These reports provide businesses with the tools to:
- Monitor and evaluate sales performance.
- Identify effective customer discounts and negotiation strategies.
- Spot expansion opportunities in promising markets.
- Make data-driven decisions to drive growth and increase market competitiveness.


## Conclusion
This project provides businesses with actionable insights to help them navigate the sales process, enhance strategies, and remain competitive in a dynamic market environment.
